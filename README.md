# Team-5

This project involves making use of OpenCV to recognize the expression in an input image 
and then solve it and then display the right answer. We used Python as our programming
language and Googleâ€™s Tesseract as the OCR Engine on this project.

We temporarily concluded this project by using a locally stored image and then processing it. 
In the future we are going to use the image captured from the webcam instead of a locally 
stored image. Also, we are going to expand the extent of calculation to higher level equations 
that involve up to even calculus.
